Data Science

	intersection of the following subjects
		domain knowledge: retial, finance, medicine, chemistry, hr, marketing, astronomy, .....
		mathematics: probability, linear algebra, calculus - machine learning
		statistics - this course
		programming - this course



Python

- multipurpose programming language
	web development
	scientific computation (data science)
	scripting or automation


- open source and free

	source code of the language is open
	community based effort


- managed by the python foundation (python.org)

- dynamically typed language

	statically typed languages - you have to provide the data type yourself
	dynamically typed languages - you don't to provide the data type explicitly

- *interpreted language - sometimes uses a compiler as well
high level language

- object oriented programming language - we will discuss this later
	in fact in python everything is an object



- modular programming language
	you can download additional libraries or packages to enhance python's functionality



What is a computer? what is a programming language?


Required installations

Base python (iterpreter and the compiler and the entire source code of the language)
10,000+ data science packages
IDE - integrated development environment
	just like ssms for sql
	jupyter notebook - reporting tool
		80% of the industry uses jupyter for reporting
	vs code, pycharm, spyder, .....


Anaconda - bundled software product that installs all these by default


	Anaconda navigator

		jupyter notebooks
			3 ways of opening
			just search jupyter notebook in the search bar
			Anaconda navigator - jupyter
			go to anaconda prompt and type jupyter notebook
